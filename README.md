This is a re-work of my LOL map file exporter. It is NOT finished or functional, but it is better made and will eventually support the new WGEO format.

The original, not so great, but mostly working version can be found on [the old branch](https://github.com/eekysam/LeagueLevel/tree/old).

Feel free to fork or contribute or whatever. Just make cool stuff, and [twitter](https://twitter.com/eekysam) is a good way to contact me.
